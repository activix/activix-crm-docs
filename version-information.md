## Support Policy

When a new version of the API is introduced, a new version of the documentation will be added with an upgrade guide and a list of changes.

We will notify all API users of the new version and of the deprecation date for the previous version\(s\).  
Previous API versions will be supported for at least 6 months.  
  
New API users will automatically gain access to the most recent version but will not have access to previous versions \(unless specifically granted for special circumstances\).
