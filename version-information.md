# Version Information

## Support Policy

When a new version of the API is introduced, a new version of the documentation will be added with an upgrade guide and a list of changes. We will also update the table below to include the new version.

We will notify all API users of the new version and of the deprecation date for the previous version\(s\). We will provide support of previous versions for at least 6 months.  
  
API users will automatically gain access to the most recent version but will not have access to previous versions \(unless specifically granted for special circumstances\).  
This means that if a user was added when v3 was the main version, he will have access to v4, v5, etc, but will never have access to v2.

| Version | Release Date | Deprecation Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| v1 | March 2, 2016 | October 31, 2018 |
| v2 | April 10, 2018 | - |
