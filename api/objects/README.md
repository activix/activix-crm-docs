# Objects

Every piece of data in the CRM is represented as an object \(also called `entity`\).  
This section explains what each object in the CRM consists of.

### Blank fields

Blank fields will always be included with the value `null` \(they are never omitted\).

### Dates

Unless otherwise specified, all timestamps are in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format in the UTC timezone.
